# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Prediction

# Abstract
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. Theconcrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age andingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate

# Data Characteristics
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory.
